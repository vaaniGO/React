I am creating this one-person twitter app soleley for self-use. I don't like the presence of an audience on twitter, but love the concept of being able to share opinions
as a 'daily log' as and when one feels those things. This web app makes use of MySQL, Node and React to create (what is now a level 1 version of) a very basic twitter app. 
How I aim to use this to study my own thought patterns (lol) is through data analysis. I will find key patterns in my own activity, use NLP to find language trends, and more!
